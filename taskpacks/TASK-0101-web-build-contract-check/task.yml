task:
  name: "TASK-0101: Validate web build/test acceptance contract"
  pillar: web
  description: >
    Validate that a web task pack expresses success via build/test signals
    (or equivalent deterministic validation) and produces reviewable artifacts,
    without deployment, plugins, network access, or environment mutation.

constraints:
  allow_network: false
  allow_cloud_mutations: false
  allow_secrets: false
  allow_long_running: false

acceptance:
  must:
    - "Acceptance commands run via acceptance.yml (format/lint/tests)."
    - "Build/test/validation is the source of truth (no deploy by default)."
    - "No deployment logic is introduced unless explicitly declared."

execution:
  use_plugins: false
  timeout_minutes: 10

artifacts:
  required:
    - artifacts/**

review:
  required: true
  notes: >
    This task validates the baseline web authoring and acceptance contract:
    build/test as truth, no deployment, scoped diffs.
