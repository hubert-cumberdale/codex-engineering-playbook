# TASK-0101 — Web Build/Test Contract Check

## Objective
Demonstrate that a web task pack can:
- Represent success via deterministic build/test/validation signals
- Produce reviewable artifacts
- Avoid deployment and environment coupling by default
- Remain fully offline and non-mutating

## Scope
- Create a minimal artifact that documents the build/test contract
- Do not introduce or modify deployment logic
- No code changes outside this task pack

## Non-goals
- Implementing a real web feature
- Adding dependencies
- Running real builds/tests (repo/framework-agnostic exemplar)
