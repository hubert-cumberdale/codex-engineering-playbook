# Spec: v1.3.0 Documentation Alignment

## Objective
Align Tier-1 and related docs with the shipped v1.3.0 platform capabilities.

## Requirements
- Update Tier-1 docs to reflect deterministic review and evidence indexing as implemented.
- Ensure enforcement posture is accurately stated (advisory local, CI blocking on objective violations only).
- Note opt-in orchestrator evidence collection and index writing.
- Remove or update future-facing statements that are no longer accurate.
- Add no new behavior or policy.

## Constraints
- Documentation-only change.
- No aspirational language.
- No runtime behavior changes.
