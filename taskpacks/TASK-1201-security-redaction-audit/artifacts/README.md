# Artifacts (evidence)

This directory is **intentionally committed empty** in the template example.
Acceptance writes deterministic evidence here:

- `evidence.json` — hashes + redaction counts + tool metadata
- `redacted_sample.txt` — sample output demonstrating redaction behavior

No secrets are used or required.
