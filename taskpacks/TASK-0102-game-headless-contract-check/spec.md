# TASK-0102 — Game Headless/Deterministic Contract Check

## Objective
Demonstrate that a game task pack can:
- Define success via deterministic, non-interactive validation signals
- Explicitly declare engine and version assumptions
- Utilize objective criteria
- Produce reviewable artifacts
- Remain fully offline and non-mutating

## Scope
- Create minimal artifacts documenting the deterministic validation contract
- Declare engine/version intent in this task pack (contract-only)
- No game code changes outside this task pack

## Non-goals
- Running a real engine build/export in this repo
- Implementing gameplay features
- Asset or tuning work
