task:
  name: "TASK-0102: Validate game headless/deterministic acceptance contract"
  pillar: game
  description: >
    Validate that a game task pack expresses success via deterministic,
    non-interactive validation signals and produces reviewable artifacts,
    without plugins, network access, or environment mutation.

constraints:
  allow_network: false
  allow_cloud_mutations: false
  allow_secrets: false
  allow_long_running: false

acceptance:
  must:
    - "Acceptance commands run via acceptance.yml (format/lint/tests)."
    - "Validation is deterministic/headless (no subjective playtest criteria)."
    - "Engine/version intent is explicitly declared in task/spec/artifacts."

execution:
  use_plugins: false
  timeout_minutes: 10

artifacts:
  required:
    - artifacts/**

review:
  required: true
  notes: >
    This task validates the baseline game authoring and acceptance contract:
    deterministic validation, engine/version declaration, no playtest criteria,
    scoped diffs.
