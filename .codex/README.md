# Codex Conventions

## Next Prompt Handoff
- Every Codex or ChatGPT session outputs `next_prompt.yml` at the repo root.
- Use `.codex/next_prompt.yml` as the template and replace values for the next session.
- The handoff captures scope, constraints, acceptance commands, and the next prompt.
- This is a convention only; no enforcement is implied.
