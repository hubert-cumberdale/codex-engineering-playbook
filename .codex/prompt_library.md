# Prompt Library

## Purpose
- Provide a repository-owned set of deterministic, bounded prompts for repeatable execution.

## Required Prompt Structure
Each prompt must include the following sections:
- Purpose
- Scope
- Hard Constraints
- Authoritative Sources
- Deliverables
- Acceptance Criteria
- Explicit Non-Goals
- Stop Conditions

## Rule
- Prompts must be deterministic and bounded.
