# Documentation Contract

## Purpose
- Enforce documentation structure requirements without changing wording.

## Scope
- Apply to repo-wide documentation only.
- Limit changes to required headings and section counts.

## Hard Constraints
- Do not change wording or meaning.
- Do not add solution-specific logic.
- Do not change orchestrator semantics.
- Do not add AI behavior.

## Authoritative Sources
- AGENTS.md
- docs/GOVERNANCE.md
- docs/Canonical Conventions.md
- docs/DOC_CHECKLIST_TIER1.md
- docs/Current Status.md
- docs/System Overview.md
- docs/Architecture & Roadmap.md

## Deliverables
- Structural compliance updates or findings.
- Validation commands, if applicable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Required headings are present.
- Section counts match the documented contract.
- Wording remains unchanged.

## Explicit Non-Goals
- No content rewrites.
- No policy changes.

## Stop Conditions
- Stop if required headings or counts are undefined.
- Stop if the request requires solution-specific logic.
