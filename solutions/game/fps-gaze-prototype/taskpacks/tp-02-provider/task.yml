task:
  name: "Implement Stage-1 provider abstraction only"
  pillar: game
  description: >
    Implement Stage-1 provider abstraction for optional eye tracking in Unreal,
    with Blueprint-accessible normalized samples, confidence gating, deterministic
    validation artifacts, and strict stage boundary controls.

engine:
  name: "Unreal Engine"
  version: "4.27"
  target: "Windows PC"

constraints:
  allow_network: false
  allow_cloud_mutations: false
  allow_secrets: false
  allow_long_running: false

acceptance:
  must:
    - "Stage-1 scope only: provider abstraction, runtime toggle, normalization, confidence gating, deterministic evidence."
    - "No intent resolution or gameplay adapter implementation."
    - "No gameplay module direct Tobii SDK calls."
    - "Null provider is default-safe and active when eye tracking is unavailable."

review:
  required: true
  notes: >
    Verify Stage-1 boundaries, deterministic outputs, and optional hardware behavior.
