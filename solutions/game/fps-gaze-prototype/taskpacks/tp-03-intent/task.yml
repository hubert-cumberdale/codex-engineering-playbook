task:
  name: "Implement Stage-2 gameplay intent layer only"
  pillar: game
  description: >
    Implement deterministic intent resolution for aim, interaction, and UI focus
    from normalized and confidence-gated gaze samples. Generate reproducible
    Stage-2 artifacts with no gameplay effects and no Stage-3/4 adapter work.

engine:
  name: "Unreal Engine"
  version: "4.27"
  target: "Windows PC"

constraints:
  allow_network: false
  allow_cloud_mutations: false
  allow_secrets: false
  allow_long_running: false

acceptance:
  must:
    - "Stage-2 scope only: deterministic intent outputs and evidence artifacts."
    - "Intent layer has no gameplay effects, no adapters, and no UI/map behavior changes."
    - "Resolver consumes normalized/gated sample semantics and deterministic fixtures."
    - "Boundary checks fail on Stage-3/4 mechanic creep and Content/Maps changes."

review:

  notes: >
    Verify deterministic resolver behavior, explicit null semantics under gating,
    and strict stage-boundary enforcement.
